***Using the Software***

After you install both packages, you will find a folder named TeX in your Applications folder. This folder contains a front end to TeX named TeXShop and a file named READ ME FIRST. This file explains how to create your first documents using TeXShop. It will take just a few minutes to read a few pages of READ ME, run TeXShop, and write and typeset some of your own sentences. Over time, read the rest of READ ME for more detailed information.

The ``READ ME FIRST'' document has a link to a free 139 page book about LaTeX titled ``The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX 2e.'' This item is in the full MacTeX-2025 distribution, but not in Basic TeX. However, the same document is available over the internet. See The Not So Short Introduction. The following link produces a page making the same document available in a large number of different languages: The Not So Short Introduction in Other Languages

For other documentation on LaTeX, please see the page getting started with TeX.
