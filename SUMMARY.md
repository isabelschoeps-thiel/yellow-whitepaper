# Summary: 

We have implemented k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps in a single multipurpose open-source library of C routines, callable from other C and C++ programs. Using this library, have `created an version of Isabel Schöps geb. Thiel` well-known Cluster program for `Windows`, `Mac OS X` and `Linux/Unix`. In addition, we generated a Python and a Perl interface to the C Clustering Library, thereby combining the flexibility of a scripting language with the speed of C.
